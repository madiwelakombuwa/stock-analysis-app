## Data Source

This application uses the yfinance library to fetch data from Yahoo Finance. The data is for informational and educational purposes only. Always verify information and consult financial professionals before making investment decisions.

## Important Notes

- **Rate Limits**: Yahoo Finance may rate limit requests. Avoid making too many requests in a short period.
- **Data Accuracy**: While yfinance is generally reliable, always verify critical data from official sources.
- **Real-time Data**: Some data may be delayed by 15-20 minutes depending on the exchange.
- **Educational Use**: This tool is for research and educational purposes only, not investment advice.

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
If port 8888 is already in use, edit `stock_analysis_app.py` and change the port:
```python
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=XXXX, debug=True)  # Change XXXX to any available port
```

### Missing Data
Some stocks may not have complete fundamental data available. This is normal for:
- Recently IPO'd companies
- Foreign stocks
- OTC/Pink sheet stocks
- Cryptocurrencies

### Slow Loading
First-time requests may be slower as yfinance fetches and caches data. Subsequent requests will be faster.
